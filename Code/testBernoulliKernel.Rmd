# Will attach more descriptive note late

Note contains 
  + Penalized likelihood method and its relation to this code 
  + Whats a reproducing kernel 
  + Bernoulli Reproducing Kernel (what is a Bernoulli polynomial and kernel) 
  + Matrix Algebra computation

# X and function values 
```{r model}
n = 100
x <- seq(1, pi, length.out = n)
y <- sin(x*4)
plot(x, y)
```



# Bernoulli Reproducing Kernel

We need the Bernoulli polynomials to create the Kernel. In the kernel we will take m=2, so we'll need to build kernel for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (B~2m~)

```{r berPolynomial}
b0 = 1
b1 = x - 1/2
b2 = x^2 - x + 1/6
b3 = x^3 - 3/2*x^2 + 1/2*x
b4 = x^4 - 2*x^3 + x^2 - 1/30
```
